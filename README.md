# CAN â†” UDP Gateway on AURIX TC375 Lite

This repository provides firmware and documentation for implementing a **bidirectional CAN â†” UDP gateway** on the **Infineon AURIXâ„¢ TC375 Lite Kit**.  
The project enables seamless communication between a CAN bus and Ethernet (UDP/IP), bridging automotive communication with IP-based systems.

## âœ¨ Features

- Bidirectional conversion: **CAN â†’ UDP** and **UDP â†’ CAN**.  
- Based on **Infineon AURIX TC375 Lite Kit** with **TLE9251V CAN transceiver**.  
- Configurable **MAC** and **IP** addresses in `bridge_common.h`.  
- Uses **lwIP stack** for UDP communication.  
- Verified with:
  - **PEAK PCAN-USB FD Pro**
  - **Saleae Logic Analyzer**
  - **PCAN-View software**
  - **Wireshark** (Ethernet monitoring)  
- Demonstrated transmission of **CAN ID 0x300h** at 500 kbit/s.

## ðŸ“¡ System Overview

- **Board A (CAN â†’ UDP):** Receives CAN frames and forwards them as UDP packets.  
- **Board B (UDP â†’ CAN):** Receives UDP packets and retransmits them on the CAN bus.  
- Both boards communicate over **UDP port 20000**.  
- PC with PEAK PCAN-USB FD Pro monitors CAN messages.  
- Saleae Logic Analyzer validates low-level signals.

## ðŸ’» Code Explanation

The firmware consists of the following modules:

- **`can_hal.c / .h`**  
  Hardware abstraction layer for CAN communication. Handles initialization, message transmission, and reception with configurable baud rate (500 kbit/s by default).

- **`udp_bridge.c / .h`**  
  Wrapper around lwIP UDP functions. Provides a clean API for sending and receiving CAN frames over UDP, with callback support.

- **`bridge_common.h`**  
  Shared structure (`CanUdpFrame`) and constants (IP, MAC, UDP port). Ensures consistent frame format between CAN and UDP.

- **`Cpu0_Main.c`**  
  Main application code that runs on the AURIX TC375 Lite.  
  - **Board A:** Initializes CAN, listens for incoming CAN frames, and sends them via UDP.  
  - **Board B:** Initializes UDP receiver, listens for incoming UDP frames, and transmits them over CAN.  

*Test message ID `0x300h` is sent periodically with DLC=8 and data bytes `0x00`. An additional test frame `0x123h` with data `0xAA` is used for verification.*

---

## ðŸš€ Results

- **Logic Analyzer:** Confirmed periodic transmission of `0x300h` frames.  
- **PCAN-View:** Successfully received both `0x300h` (zero data) and `0x123h` (0xAA pattern) frames.  
- **Cycle Times:** 1 ms for test frame generation, stable reception over extended runtime.
